## File types

A README.md file in the directory of each publication provides an overview over available  data products, figures, source names, and citations.
A Bibtex file (*bibtex.bib*) allows to include easily the citation for each publication into a Latex-style document.

The following files types are used and described in more details below:

- VER*.yaml: Observational details and results like observation time, detection significance, source position and morphology, and spectral models results.
- VER*sed.ecsv: Spectral flux points including error and upper limits
- VER*lc.ecsv: Light-curve data (integrated gamma-ray fluxes vs time)
- VER*.fits: Statistical significance or excess counts sky map (if available)
- VER*table.ecsv: additional tabulated data (if available)
